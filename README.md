## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the application.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Before running the application, you need to install the required Python packages. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project. Then run the following command:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs the Python packages listed there.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

You need to configure the required environment variables for the application. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` and `PORTKEY_API_KEY` as follows:

``` bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_open_ai_api_key>
PORTKEY_API_KEY=<your_portkey_api_key>
```

Replace `<your_open_ai_api_key>` and `<your_portkey_api_key>` with your actual API keys.

### Step 3: Run the Application

To start the application, navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run the following command:

`streamlit run app.py`

This command launches the Streamlit application in your default web browser.

## Using the Application

Once the application is running, follow these steps to process and preview your tax forms:

1. **Upload Forms:** In the web interface that opens, upload your W2 and 1040 forms by clicking on the respective upload buttons.

## Notes

- Ensure your `.env` file is never shared or committed to a public repository. Include it in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of your API keys.
